                                    Goal 1: COMMUNICATING - Oral Communication
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    
                                    	My first goal this work term at Roadmunk was to improve my oral communication when it come to sharing my progress, thoughts and findings as I work as a tester on a development team.

								</h3>
								<p>
                                    To meet this goal my action plan involved preparing for daily standups in advance so that I always had something meaningful to contribute, or was never at a loss for works. I also planned to practice how to properly express my thoughts without getting flusters, confused or overwhelmed (it’s harder than it sounds). I also made it a point to observe how the other testers on the team carry out themselves in a professional manner.  
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    I feel that I made really good progress with this goal! At the beginning of the term I was quite nervous to speak up during standups and team meetings mostly due to my lack of knowledge in the role. Over the course of the term I gained a lot of confidence due to my continued understanding of the job and thanks to the positive feedback my teammates and supervisor always gave me. I was ene able to co-host a team retrospective and 1on1 with my supervisor. By the end of the term standups and other team meetings were hardly intimidating at all.  
                                </p>

								<h3>
									<br/>
									Goal 2: CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Inquiry & Analysis <br/><br/>

                                    This goal was mainly to focus on thinking and how to analzye code/interfaces with the mindset of a Tester. 

                                    Sounds pretty straight forward! But having never worked in a testing role before, this was something I knew I would need to master or at least better understand.
								</h3>
								<p>
                                    I planned to achieve this by observing both the testers AND developers on the team to see how they collaborate. Specifically what the developers communicate to the testers and what the testers in return ask questions about. This was done primarily by partaking in “Shadowing” sessions where I could get a chance to sit in on testing sessions and view my fellow testers as they take on Jira tickets. And of course, I planed to ask many questions myself. 
									<br/><br/>
                                    Now that the term is over I feel like I have learned so much in the areas of testing and can now say I have a better understanding of what it means to be a software tester. After spending many hours working independently and along my fellow testers, I have really learned how to think like a tester and get lost in exploratory testing. I know what to look for now when being handed a feature/bug to test. Before I would look at an issue from the perspective of a developer but now I feel my mind has really widened in terms of perspective and how to analyze issues.
                                
                                </p>

								<h3>
									<br/>
                                    Goal 3: LITERACY - Technological Literacy<br/><br/>
                                    
                                    Simply put, this goal was to learn and become familiar with the Roadmunk application itself - how it works and how the users interact with it. By being a tester, it's my job to be a voice of quality on the team, so naturally I would need to understand the product well. 
                                
                                </h3>
								<p>
                                    My plan for achieving this goal was to spend a good amount of time outside of testing to become more experienced and familiar with the product. Doing this would help me become a better tester by understanding how the product itself should actually work. I continuously read up on the documentation provided online and shared across all teams. I also got involved in training and other sessions that would come my way in order to gain any exposure to the product that I could benefit from.
                                    <br/><br/> 
                                    Naturally after spending 4 months working with the project, I have learned a great deal about the application itself and how clients and developers alike interact with it. 
								</p>

								<h3>
									<br/>
                                    Goal 4: PROFESSIONAL & ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR - Personal Organization/Time Management <br/><br/>
                                    
                                    This goal was rather straightforward - learn how to manage my time and work effectively as a tester.

								</h3>
										<p>		
                                            Again, in the past I had always worked as a developer alongside testers, but never as a tester myself. I had experience planning and managing my time with development work such as making educated guesses on how long particular tasks would take to build. However testing was a completely new area. I had no idea how long testing procedures would take. My plan to be successful with this goal involved taking on Jira tickets daily while monitoring my time spent on each in the beginning of the term. I would also make good use of “free” time between testing by doing debriefs and further educating myself. I planned to optimize my time to make the most out of each day and to think ahead for days to come. All of this was done alongside taking physical and digital notes. 
                                        <br/><br/> 
                                        	Once I got comfortable with the job and fell into the routine of working remotely, I really go the hand of managing my time. Over time I better understood how long it would take to work on certain tickets, the effort needed and how to reach out to other team members. I was able to sign in each day, report my findings, communicate all while being productive and seeing the fruits of my efforts come to life. I am confident in how I managed my time and efficiency at Roadmunk and was happy to see how many tasks I was able to complete.  
								</p>

								<h3>
									<br/>
									Goal 5: PROFESSIONAL & ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR - Teamwork <br/><br/>
                                    
                                    Lastly, my final goal was just to become a useful, contributing member of my team.
                                
                                </h3>
								<p>
                                        My action plan towards achieving this goal was simple. I aimed to take part in daily/weekly scrum meetings and try to offer meaningful discussion, engage with my coworkers during work and outside of it, offer assistance where I could, demonstrate my eagerness to learn and contribute and finally… do my best. 😊 


                                        No matter where I work I will always wonder whether I am truly a useful member of a team. This is because I'm an over thinker naturally. My the end of my term and after continuously speaking about it with the rest of the team, I think I feel confident in saying that I was viewed as a helpful member of the team :) I think I fair share of work and tried my best to help when I could. I ended almost every day satisified with my contributions which to me is the hardest area to find satisfaction in. This along with hearing the postive feedback from the rest of the team really helped me feel that I was in fact an actual useful contributing member of the team.

                                At Roadmunk, my job role was as a Software Test Specialist co-op. As previously mentioned, this was my first experience in the role of a tester and not a developer. This alone made the experience all the more exciting and eye opening – being on the other end of development and getting to look at the work from a new set of eyes. As a Software Test Specialist, I was a member of an 11 person development team called the REDUX team. The team consisted of developers, testers, product managers, designers and the like. As the title suggests, in this role it was my job to test the developers work, but not as a gatekeeper, but instead by working closely alongside the developers. The main method for testing we used on the team was a practice called Function Exploratory Testing. This involved manually poking around and working with the software in a behavioral context to searched for bugs. In a sense we act as if we are the clients ourselves and aim to find issues. I would naturally ask lots of questions to help understand the areas of risk and refine test strategies sometimes digging into the code to play with scripts to help understand the solution. 
								Aside from exploratory testing, we also used Session Based Testing to timebox our exploratory end-to-end testing sessions. I worked closely alongside Customer Success, Development, and Product teams to understand quality risk areas on releases and generally acted as a voice of quality within the development team. I rough day to day experience on the team would flow somewhat like: taking part in a daily standup each morning at 9am where we all discuss what we did yesterday and what we plan to work on today along with any notable updates. Throughout the day I would pick up any tickets on the team Jira board that were in the Waiting for QA column. After marking them as In Testing, I would get ready for my testing session. As a tester there are multiple steps needed to be taken before actually starting testing such as checking what kind of testing has already been done, the scope of the changes, understanding what the actual changes was and how it was implemented, how to replicate any issues, clearing up any misunderstandings between the change description verse discussion during development and more! The list goes on. Once I felt I had all the information I needed I would being a testing session which would be labelled either short, medium or long according to the time taken. These sessions involved exploratory testing practices on the working branch while documenting all my findings. If any issues where found I would report these bugs to the developer and create new Jira tickets respectively and make the call on whether to pass the changes or not. Once done with a testing session, it would go to debriefing from another fellow tester for a second look. Once we were both on the same page with the testing coverage I would give the go ahead and merge the changes. Alongside testing I even showed interest in picking up some starter friendly development tickets and got to actually try out some coding! Needless to say there were many different opportunities at my disposal and I always had something I could be working on

                                My co-op term at Roadmunk was a wonderful experience to say the least! Working from home during a pandemic is not the easiest and it greatly affects the amount of boding and interacting one can have with their team, however I can truly say that I enjoyed my time and really felt like a member of the team. I also learned so much as a tester, gaining valuable knowledge I know I will definitely use down the line in my career. I think I was able to grow in a lot of different areas and reach all of my learning goals thanks to the environment I was able to work in. Not only did I learn testing practices but I also got to do some development work further exposing myself to both sides as a programmer and tester – something I think a lot of people should try themselves. This position was incredible informative, insightful and enjoyable. To name some of the skills and tools I learned along the way, please see the list below:  <br/>
								<br/>
								<li>Further Javascript and HTML programming</li><br/> 
								<li>Functional Exploratory Testing </li><br/>
								<li>Time-boxed Session-based Testing</li><br/>
								<li>Writing Testing Session Documents</li><br/>
								<li>Debriefing other testing sessions </li><br/>
								<li>Further white-box and black-box testing practices</li><br/>
								<li>Real world agile methodologies and working through the QA process</li><br/>
								<li>Replicating multiple different types of bugs/issues </li><br/>
								<li>Reporting and communicating my findings across multiple teams</li><br/> 
								<li>Participating and leading team meetings</li><br/>
								<li>Deeper understanding of Accessibility compliance</li><br/> 
								<li>Further Git skills </li><br/>
								<li>The following software: Segment, Salesforce, Jenkins, Playground, Papertrail, AWS, Sendgrid</li><br/>

								Writing out this final co-op term concludes the my co-op for my current degree of Software Engineering at the University of Guelph and to be honest, I can’t believe its actually over. It feels surreal to be nearing the end of the road, a point that always seemed to far away. There are so many people I would like to give my thanks to for helping me have such a wonderful final co-op term at Roadmunk. To my supervisor and manager, Garth, who was probably the most easy going guy I’ve ever met along with all his jokes, to the rest of the whole REDUX team. Thank you all for helping we feel welcome from the very start. I know it’s not easy to bond entirely from across a screen thanks for everything being remote, but they all went out of their way to make me feel comfortable and safe. The little socials and weekly Shiny and New presentations were so much fun! Plus all the merch I got is a huge plus 😉 I’ll miss the standups, the water-cooler, and all the jokes we told across slack. It was a pleasure to work at Roadmunk and I truly hope I have the change to cross paths with many of the other there again someday. <br/>
								<br/>
								And of course, thank you to Laura Gatto for being a great co-op coordinator and always answering right on time to all my questions and concerns, and thank you to Greg Klotz for taking the time to review my report after so many others. <br/>
