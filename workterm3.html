								<h3>
									Goal 1: GLOBAL UNDERSTANDING - Global Understanding<br/><br/>

									By working for Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, the very first goal that came to mind is that I have a lot to learn and understand about agricultural data. From soil, nutrient and crop data to field work and the type of data collected, there is so much about the depth and context of the actual work that is completely new to me as a software engineering student. It is my goal to have a deeper understanding in the area of agriculture and agri-food by the end of my coop term. Not only did I feel this would be important in being successful in this position alone, but by understanding that as a software developer, the actual projects you can be told to work on can be on ANY subject (not just tech related), I feel I got an idea for what it could like working for a client of a completely difference area of expertise needing technical assistance - and I was able to see how to bridge that gap by learning about their area in return.
								</h3>
								<p>
									To improve, I planned to extensive research on the data I would actually be working with and ask many questions to my supervisors. Since the data was very large (big data), I had to spend a fair amount of time analyzing, note taking and organizing the data. This all lead two one eventual cleaning stage. 
									<br/><br/>
									After finishing my term, I can say I feel very pleased with the amount of knowledge I gained in the area of agriculture data. I had no prior experience working in such a different environment with data such as this however I was able to learn the context of it through extensive attention to detail and by seeking out help from my supervisors. I feel I have learned much about their work as well through field work and deep discussions. I am happy with my broadened understanding on agricultural data and I think I may even be interested in working with this kind of data in the future.
								</p>

								<h3>
									<br/>
									Goal 2: COMMUNICATING - Integrative Communication<br/><br/>

									I would like to be able to incorporate my understanding of computational science and software learning within a different area of application. This means understanding both areas and understanding how to actually apply/merge both in an effective way.
								</h3>
								<p>
									I planned to achieve this by improving my software skills. This meant improving my coding style, gaining exposure to new software tools such as Microsoft Power BI, Excel Dashboards, etc. I made it my duty to observe the practices of my colleagues to get a feel for how problems are tackled and how I can improve on that will my knowledge added to the mix. 
									<br/><br/>
									With this position being very self-disciplined and requiring a lot of self-exploration, I am proud with how I was able to take what I already knew in my computational skills and incorporate them with new technologies and platforms to produce results. I used a language I know such as python in a way I had previously not done and expanded my expertise in the skill through research and experimentation. I learned how to manipulate large data files in excel through python and prepare the data for visualization software. 
								</p>

								<h3>
									<br/>
									Goal 3: CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Inquiry & Analysis<br/><br/>
										As a data analysis assistant, it will be my job to work with large data sets and analyze said data. I will need to improve my skills of cleaning, organizing and understanding the significance of data when in large quantities.
								</h3>
								<p>
									To achieve this goal, I needed to really work towards improving and managing my organizational skills. I would take frequent notes and actually read and review them soon after writing them to keep my understanding of topics fresh. I also tried to improve my time management prioritization skills to make working with more data less overwhelming.
									<br/><br/> 
									I had prior experience working with big data in previous co-ops however it was primarily contained in a database. This was the first time it was my job to clean, organize and manage large sets of data while analyzing and understanding the depth of the data. I feel I had done a good job in this and am proud of how I managed such a large task.
								</p>

								<h3>
									<br/>
									Goal 4:PROFESSIONAL & ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR - Personal Organization/Time Management<br/><br/>

										As previously mentioned I believe working on my time management and organizational skills will be a key aspect of being efficient and good at my job. I feel confident in my time management and organizational skills already, however there is always room for improvement and in a foreign area of work, I will especially need to reconsider and re-evaluate my approach to accomplishing my new tasks.
								</h3>
										<p>		My action plan included keeping my folders, work area and documents organized. I would date all papers and write a lot of my thoughts down on paper. As a visual learner I usually need to see things in order to understand them. I made sure to keep track of tasks and deadlines as well as plan ahead. I didn't hesitate to consult with my supervisor on how I could best be spending my time. 


										<br/><br/> 
										Similar to my previous goal, I feel I did a good job in managing my time and organization skills in this role. Since I have not taken on a role requiring me to have so much self-discipline, this was a refreshing change and challenge that I feel I managed well seeing as I was able to complete the majority of what was originally planned for me.
								</p>

								<h3>
									<br/>
									Goal 5: PROFESSIONAL & ETHICAL BEHAVIOUR <br/><br/>
									It is always one of my goals to improve on my teamwork. Since I will be working in a different environment compared to what I am used to, I will have to adjust to the new practices I will need to apply in working with a new team.
								</h3>
								<p>
										To achieve this I planned to get to know my coworkers, learn about the work environment, respect everyone - their work and their skill levels and finally, to do my part and help out when I can.

										I am very satisfied with how I got along with the other employees at agriculture Canada. I felt comfortable and welcomed in the environment and never felt pressured or afraid to speak up or ask for assistance form anyone. I feel I made strong bonds and relationships that I look forward to continuing when I return for my text term in January 2020.

								My job at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada was as an Agri-Environmental Data Analysis Assistant. I had the chance to work hands on with soil, nutrient and water management scientists and engineers with their on-going projects that contribute to the development of innovative solutions for water and soil conservation at a farm level. These projects work towards making landscape-scale assessments of agricultural sustainability and most importantly on the subject of nutrient loss for the Great Lakes.
								My exact job was to assist with the current phase of an in-progress project based on Temporal and Spatial Analysis of Agriculture Production Systems in Ontario and the Lake Erie basin. The project relied on a custom Typology ruleset created at AAFC. With the project already being in process and quite a few phases into development, it became my job to manage the project and develop innovative solutions towards completing it. With the job role being very self-disciplined, the early stages required taking a lot of time familiarizing myself with the data structure and hierarchy. I researched and discussed with my supervisors on their ideal image for the end goal of the project, in other words how we wanted this data to be transformed into something meaningful. I helped propose visual concepts and prototypes for what this project could transform into. Once a feasible end goal was decided upon, it became my job to consolidate, clean and format all the data we had, also while keeping track of anything missing data and the sources. Once this step was completed I moved onto the next phase which was handling suppressed values in all the data files. This is when the majority of the coding came into play. There was some trial and error between choosing which language to work in, changing from SQL to Python. I had to develop a procedure that would be able to parse individual masses of data and implement our custom Typology ruleset. This phase took a considerable about of time and was the final stage I was able to reach during my 4 month period. I was able to finish this suppression procedure for all the Ontario files for census years of 1981-2016, allowing them to be ready for QA.

								My co-op term at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada has been a very insightful and enjoyable experience. It was a different environment to what I am already used to and in a lot of ways, a breath of fresh air. I was able to experience how it feels to work in a real world private sector environment. I gained hands on field work experience where I was able to actually visit the field sites where we get our data from. It was eye opening getting to see what goes on behind the scenes of the data a developer would normally just be handed. This was also my first time being in a position that required so much self-discipline and management. It was enjoyable all the while still being challenging, because I really had to learn how to manage my time differently. Not only did I gain useful working practices but I also learned how to use a language I was already familiar with but in a much deeper method. I learned about new data visualization software and how it feels to take on a bit of a research position. It was all part of an incredible learning experience and I very much enjoyed it! To name some of the skills and tools I learned along the way, please see the list below:  <br/>
								<br/>
								<li>Advanced Python/SQL Programming</li><br/>
								<li>Further knowledge in Tableau Software </li><br/>
								<li>Microsoft Power BI and Excel Dashboards</li><br/>
								<li>Product Management and Organization Skills</li><br/>
								<li>Collaborating between teams working in difference provinces</li><br/>
								<li>Further Microsoft Excel techniques </li><br/>
								<li>Real world agile methodologies and seeing through the QA process </li><br/>

								There are so many people I would like to give my thanks to for helping he have such a wonderful co-op experience. My two supervisors Pamela Joosse and Natalie for being so kind and welcoming. I never felt pressured or afraid to approach of consult them if I had questions. I am also grateful to have been given the opportunity to take part in the hands on field days throughout the summer where we visited sites all across southern Ontario. These days were so much fun and were a nice change of pace from working at the computer! Thanks to the other members of the science technology branch that were also so friendly and willing to chat with me and the other co-op, (Pat, Sonja, Keith, Jean!). Last but not least, thanks to the general HR department of AAFC and to SPROUT for making sure us co-op were already doing alright and that we were meeting out co-op needs. I have accepted to return to AAFC for my next co-op term in the Winter of 2020, thus I can say I look forward to seeing you all again in the near future!<br/>
								<br/>
								And of course, thank you to Laura Gatto for being a great co-op coordinator and always answering right on time to all my questions and concerns, and thank you to Greg Klotz for taking the time to review my report after so many others. <br/>
