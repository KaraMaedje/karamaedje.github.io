                                    Goal 1: CRITICAL & CREATIVE THINKING - Inquiry & Analysis<br/><br/>
                                    
                                    My first goal this time around at AAFC was to learn to better optimize my tools and time as a developer in order to produce concrete and legitimate results.

								</h3>
								<p>
                                    To improve, I planned to do better reasearch on the tools I would plan to use instead of jumping straight into the first tool that came to mind. I learned that this 
                                    wouls save me alot of time in the long run, making the right software choices early. I planned to bring up any issues or questions I would have early in development 
                                    to save myself more time and boost a mor eefficient work flow. 
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    After finishing my term, I feel like I have made impressive results with this goal. I was no longer hestitant to ask either of my supervisors any questions and instead 
                                    approached them as soon as questions arised for me. This also encouraged me to initiate more discussion and meetings where I could lead and demonstrate my progress. I have 
                                    also become wiser in regards to selecting the right software to use for certains tasks and how some truly are better fits for certains tasks. 
                                </p>

								<h3>
									<br/>
									Goal 2: COMMUNICATING - Written Communication <br/><br/>

                                    This goal was mainly to focus on improving on my project documentation skills.

                                    By working on such a complex, large project, I realized I would have a lot of room to improve in terms of how I would write out a technical report for example. I also knew
                                    that I was going to be needed to spend a heafty amount of time documenting how far the project has come.
								</h3>
								<p>
                                    Again, I planned to achieve this by for one, starting early. Writing takes time. I knew I would need to begin writing out project documents earlier and add to them 
                                    iteratively throughout the course of the project in order to catch smaller, important details that I might miss if trying to write out a report after the fact.
									<br/><br/>
                                    I had a great deal of time to work on this particular goal considering a big portion of my term was spent creating a proper documentation and report of the project as a whole. 
                                    I had multiple chances to converse with my supervisor on how to create a more comprehensive report and improve my written skills. I am actually very happy with how this goal 
                                    turned out in the end. :) 
                                
                                </p>

								<h3>
									<br/>
                                    Goal 3: LITERACY - Technological Literacy<br/><br/>
                                    
                                    Simply put, this goal was to improve my programming skills in Python. Similar to my last goal, after working on such a massive project with so much data at my 
                                    disposal, I have realized that my skills in Python could greatly improve. This time around I would access to more advance techniques allow me to explore even more.
                                
                                </h3>
								<p>
                                    My plan to acheive this goal was to reference popular libraries and tools that can make my code more efficient and better to read for other programmers and non-programmers. Of 
                                    course I also planned to continue to document my code heavily.
                                    <br/><br/> 
                                    I was able to work hands on with a project that implemented advance Python programming across multiple connected scripts. Because of this I gained exposure to these new 
                                    techniques and was encouraged to explore statistical methods and how they can be implemented in a project such as the Ontario Typology project I had been working on with 
                                    graphs such as the Mann Kendal method and more. 
								</p>

								<h3>
									<br/>
                                    Goal 4: LITERACY - Visual Literacy <br/><br/>
                                    
                                    This goal was rather straightforward, get better with data visualization softwares.

								</h3>
										<p>		
                                            My original action plan for this goal was to continue my research and understanding of popular visualization software available to AAFC. (There are many limitations).
                                            I wanted to learn to also be able to pick the best option available and become efficient in my use of it/it's techniques to best communicate the needs for the project. 
                                        <br/><br/> 
                                        We weren't able to make it too far into the visualization phase of the project unfortunetly however I was still able to experiment with the particular data for the 
                                        project in some softwares such as Tableau, R and a little bit in Microsoft Power BI. This allowed to me brainstorm and think of ways I could help visualize this kind 
                                        of data moving forward and has encouraged me to find a chance to try it out for myself. 
								</p>

								<h3>
									<br/>
									Goal 5: COMMUNICATING - Integrative Communication<br/><br/>
                                    
                                    By working for Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, I have a lot to learn and understand about agricultural data. From soil, nutrient and crop data to field work and 
                                    the type of data collected, there is so much about the depth and context of the actual work and data that is completely new to me as a software engineering student. 
                                    It is my goal to have a deeper understanding in the area of agriculture and agri-food by the end of my coop term.
                                
                                </h3>
								<p>
                                        My action plan towards acheiving this goal was as follows: 
                                        1. Do research on the data I am working on.
                                        2. Continuously ask questions.
                                        3. Since the data is very large, spend time properly analyzing, note taking and organizing/cleaning the data.

                                        After completing my second co-op term at AgCanada, I think I can say I have gained a fairly decent understanding of the agricultural data I had been working with. 
                                        From the many Ontario census divisions and their census data consisting of farm types and outputs, I feel much more educated on the area and how to apply such a 
                                        different field of expertise into a computational context.

                                My job at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada was as an Agri-Environmental Data Analysis Assistant. I had the chance to work hands on with soil, nutrient and 
                                water management scientists and engineers with their on-going projects that contribute to the development of innovative solutions for water and soil conservation 
                                at a farm level. These projects work towards making landscape-scale assessments of agricultural sustainability and most importantly on the subject of nutrient loss 
                                for the Great Lakes. My exact job was to assist with the current phase of an in-progress project based on Temporal and Spatial Analysis of Agriculture Production 
                                Systems in Ontario and the Lake Erie basin. The project relied on a custom Typology ruleset created at AAFC. With the project already being in process and quite 
                                a few phases into development, it became my job to manage the project and develop innovative solutions towards completing it. Last summer during my third co-op 
                                term, I had been the first student to begin working on this project in it's current phase, during the fall, another student took over from where I had left off and 
                                upon my return I continued where he left off. The project this time around was in more of a quality check and revise and editing phase. It became my job to go over 
                                all the scripts and make sure they were working as needed to be. This meant understanding all the suppression method implementations and testing their outputs on the 
                                data. I had to make some changes to the scripts and then book meetings to make sure the whole team agreed on the outcomes. Most of my term this time was spent working on
                                perfecting the suppression estimation implementation and correcting the outputs so that the data could finally be used towards the last stages of the project, visualization.

                                My second co-op term at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada has been a wonderful learning experience. Like my first term at AAFC, it had a different atmosphere to the standard 
                                of development environments. This was almost relaxing in its own sense. I was able to experience how it feels to work in a real world private sector environment. This time around 
                                I had the opportunity to get into more deeper statistics in coding and experiemnt with advanced python programming techniques as the code got more and more complicated. Like my last 
                                time at AAFC, it is a position that requires a lot of self-discipline and management. This alone is a task to master and I feel I was able to grow a lot in these aspects.
                                Not only did I gain useful working practices but I also learned how to use a language I was already familiar with but in a much deeper method. I continued to learned about new 
                                data visualization software and how it feels to take on a bit of a research position. To name some of the skills and tools I learned along the way, please see the list below:  <br/>
								<br/>
								<li>Advanced Python/SQL Programming</li><br/>
								<li>Further knowledge in Tableau Software </li><br/>
								<li>Microsoft Power BI and Excel Dashboards</li><br/>
                                <li>Product Management and Organization Skills</li><br/>
                                <li>Picking up and working on complex existing code</li><br/>
                                <li>Self Discipline Skills</li><br/>
								<li>Collaborating between teams working in difference provinces</li><br/>
								<li>Further Microsoft Excel techniques </li><br/>
                                <li>Real world agile methodologies and seeing through the QA process </li><br/>
                                <li>Taking on the role of a QA/Tester</li><br/>

								There are so many people I would like to give my thanks to for helping he have such a wonderful 2nd co-op experience. At AAFC. 
								My two supervisors Pamela Joosse and Natalie for being so kind and welcoming. I never felt pressured or afraid to 
								approach of consult them if I had questions. They were a joy to have as supervisors. Thanks to the other members of the science 
								technology branch that were also so friendly and willing to chat with me and the other co-ops, (Pat, Sonja, Keith, Jean!). 
								Last but not least, thanks to the general HR department of AAFC and to SPROUT for making sure us co-op were always 
								doing alright and that we were meeting out co-op needs. It was truly a please to return to AAFC and see so many familiar
								face again. It really was a shame that COVID-19 had to interupt the term sending everyone to work from home, however I
								was still able to complete my work and a big thank you to everyone again for being so flexible and understanding during
								this stressful time. :) <br/>
								<br/>
								And of course, thank you to Laura Gatto for being a great co-op coordinator and always answering right on time to all my questions and concerns, and thank you to Greg Klotz for taking the time to review my report after so many others. <br/>
