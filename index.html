									Kenna’s focus is to collect, manage and coordinate client data then compile it into something more while matching the desired client outcome. I worked in the Business Intelligence Web Development division, responsible for overseeing client masses of data and transforming it into presentable, more meaningful files. The BI team specializes in the visualization of data and analytics creating reports that allow clients to gain insight from their own data that can enhance business and ethical decisions.

								<h3>
									Goal 1:
									Improving my communication skills – After some time working between two teams I learned that I had room for improvement when it comes to integrating my knowledge and produced results of code with those who would QA it.
								</h3>
								<p>
									To improve, I planned on engaging more with the QA team about my development plan and ensuring that I understood theirs so that we were always on the same page. I worked to improve the quality of my code and reports so that it would be more clear to someone who has never coded before.
									<br/><br/>
									After finishing my second term, I can say that I left with confidence in my work as well as how I worked with the QA team. I improved the quality of my code used in the reports for the analytics team and after receiving their positive feedback, I think it's fair to say that they were pleased with the work I handed them for QA. I was pleased myself because the QA processes became more efficient and clear between the teams. This included what needed to be changed, how, what worked and what we liked.
								</p>

								<h3>
									<br/>
									Goal 2:
									Increase my Critical thinking and depth of understanding - I have gotten much stronger in SQL programming and Tableau software and after working on smaller projects, I became ready to take on more challenging tasks.
								</h3>
								<p>
									I planned to achieve this by showing my interests in more challenging work to my supervisor while also demonstrating that I was ready to take these tasks on through the qualtity of my work.
									<br/><br/>
									Near the end of my term I was working on larger, more complex reports. By sharing the quality of work I could produce, this showed my supervisors that I was ready and confident to take on larger assignments which they glady assigned to me. I was able to work on these with limited supervision and assistance all while learning more and more along the way until the very end.
								</p>

								<h3>
									<br/>
									Goal 3:
									Technical Literacy - I wanted to begin learning a new programming language by the end of my second term.
								</h3>
								<p>
									If I could find time during my work, I planned for this to be a more personal goal and side achievement to start.
									<br/><br/> 
									Although I was usually quite busy during my co-op, I did find time to begin learning another programming language like I planned. I started learning Ruby in my spare time in hopes of broadening my understanding of dynamic languages that may assist me in the mobile development world - one I have no current experience with. I will continue studying this language in my own time until I am confident enough to fully work in it. 
								</p>

								<h3>
									<br/>
									Goal 4:
									Continued improvement of my teamwork skills - I wanted to continue making positive, friendly relationships with my coworkers and teammates to improve the work environment. 
								</h3>
								<p>
									I can confidently say that I left my co-op with strong relationships formed and even friends made. I worked very well with my team mates bonding over lunch and activities inside and outside of work. This really helped me to engage better with my co-workers creating a truly positive work environment that I was actually sad to leave.
								</p>

								<h3>
									<br/>
									Goal 5:
									Oral Communication - Improving my oral communication and presenting of my ideas/findings to my peers and teammates. 
								</h3>
								<p>
									I have anxiety when it comes to public speaking and even sometimes sharing my own ideas, but I think I did fairly well on this goal during the second half of my term. This has been more of an internal struggle to overcome than anything but after working with my team and some of the same faces for so long, I grew very comfortable around them. With my understanding of the work becoming stronger, I was able to share my thoughts and ideas more confidently than I would have in the first half of my co-op where I was more unsure. I myself am very proud of the work I made on this goal knowing that it is one of the harder ones for me. I will continue to work towards public speaking, oral presenting and sharing of my thoughts with others.

								My job at Kenna was as a Web/SQL Application Developer. As a member of the BI development team, it was my role to see the creation and employment of client requested reports and data pulls. To begin a project such as a report, the first step would be the visual build carried out by the communications team, after which would be consulted by we, the developers. After agreeing upon a feasible method of data representation for the client report, it became my job to create it. Working in Microsoft SQL Server, I would navigate through the vast database of client data, compiling all the required information I would need into an accurate procedure meeting the company’s standards. With this procedure of code, I would begin the next level of building the report, this would be done using Tableau software. Tableau is used for data visualization and can manipulate it with its own coding techniques. I had the joy of working with both SQL programming and Tableau for the first time during my co-op terms at Kenna and found them to be extremely enjoyable tools that I would love pursuing in a future role. Once a report is finished it gets published to the server and sent off to the clients for their business needs. Another important part of the job involves being heavily involved in the QA process of these projects. Seeing them through the development, testing and publishing stages are necessary in order to see the project to the end; if there is a bug with it or a requirement change, it’s my job to move back to development and see it done.  <br/>

								My co-op term at Kenna has been one of the most insightful, enjoyable and eye-opening experience I’ve had the joy of partaking in. I worked on an amazing team over my 8-months, all treating me not as a simple co-op, but their equal. Everyone, and that is not an exaggeration, EVERYONE, was always so kind, and ready to provide assistance if I ever needed it. By working in such a positive environment, I was able to improve my confidence in my work, also allowing me to learn more at ease, despite deadlines of course. The office made it their job to welcome all co-ops and treat all the workers with fun activities from time-to-time keeping the atmosphere enjoyable. Not only did I learn a new language and software tool, but I also learned other useful techniques I can apply in my daily computer tasks and in future work experiences. The work I was assigned was challenging but not a burden, I was able to put my knowledge to the test, see the fruits of my efforts and still always find more that I could learn. Seeing the projects I had worked on get used in the real world is a wonderful feeling of accomplishment that I’m so grateful to have been able to contribute toward. To name some of the skills and tools I learned along the way, please see the list below:  <br/>
								<br/>
								<li>SQL Programming</li><br/>
								<li>Tableau Software </li><br/>
								<li>Bitbucket version control and hosting</li><br/>
								<li>LotusNotes for data entry and retrieval</li><br/>
								<li>Jira project tracking software</li><br/>
								<li>Further Microsoft Excel techniques </li><br/>
								<li>Daily Standup and Weekly Scrum meetings</li><br/>
								<li>Real world agile methodologies and seeing through the QA process </li><br/>

								There are so many people I would like to give my thanks to, if I could personally tell them all I would, but to be concise, I would like to thank everyone that I personally worked with during my time at Kenna. My direct development team including my two supervisors, Jeremie and Josh who taught me more than I could ever imagine as well as for answering every little question I’d throw at them. My fellow co-ops Milan and James and teammate Shwetha, they were all a joy to work with and made my feel like we were truly a team and friends. Special thanks to the QA team consisting of Liz, Jen, Runa, Anabelle and Samir who worked hard to QA our work and always did so with a smile. Thank you to the HR department at Kenna for organizing so many fun events like the Kenna cruise, holiday parties, team bonding events and all the lunches we were given. Thank you to Andrew for ensuring that myself and the other co-ops always had someone to talk to when we faced any challenges and big thanks to the rest of the Kennadians for creating such a wonderful work environment that I miss already and had such a pleasure of working in. <br/>
								<br/>
								Last but not least, thank you to Laura Gatto for being a great co-op coordinator and always answering right on time to all my questions and concerns, and thank you to Greg Klotz for taking the time to review my report after so many others. <br/>
